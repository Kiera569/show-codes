# `now-release`

> Automatic `release` template for `now` deployments

## Usage

In the directory you are releasing from, create a `release.js` file containing:

```js
module.exports = require('now-release')
```

to automatically include the deployment URL in your release notes.

## Config

By default, the deployment URL will be read from your clipboard, or from the `NOW_URL` (or `URL`) environment variable.

```sh
$ NOW_URL="https://carbon-lwewejskfs.now.sh" release patch
```
